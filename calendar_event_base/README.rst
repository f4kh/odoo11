Calendar Event Base
===================
This module makes several changes to the calendar module:

- In the event.calendar model it defines the name field as translatable.
- It sets month view as the default calendar view.
- It adds the event description in the event pop-up window if not empty.
- In the event pop-up window, it shows the attendee list if not empty.
- In the event box it uses 'attendees' instead of 'records' if not empty.
- In the event search view it defines extra filters and group by.

Installation
